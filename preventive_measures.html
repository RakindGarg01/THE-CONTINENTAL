		<br>
		As a guest of The Continental Hotel And Resorts, we appreciate your loyalty and the trust you place in us as a travel partner.<br><br>
		Recognizing the ongoing and increased uncertainty that coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing around the world, our highest priority is the health and wellbeing of our guests and employees. With that in mind we wanted to update you on the actions we have taken in response to the outbreak.
		<br><br>
		<b>Alert! Your travel destination may be subject to state or local laws that require isolation or quarantine upon entry, or other mandates such as wearing a face covering while in public spaces. Ensure that you review any requirements prior to travel.

		For the health and safety of guests and hotel colleagues, and in line with local legislation and current health authority guidance, some hotels are also operating with modified or reduced services (e.g. reduction in restaurant and bar service, alternative guest room furnishings and/or amenities).

    <div class="parent">
        <div class="son">
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18px;">All hotels and other hospitality units must take suitable measures to restrict any further transmission of COVID-19 while providing accommodation and other tourist services. The SOP aims to minimize all possible physical contacts between Staff and Guests and maintain social distancing and other preventive and safety measures against COVID-19.If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!. Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible. Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
                Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin. Don’t use masks with valves.</p>

      We want to help you plan future travel with confidence and provide our guests with options, in what is still a dynamic situation.<br><br>

        At the beginning of 2020 we removed many of the more restrictive, non-refundable rates and added additional flexible rates for guests to choose from. We also offered flexibility throughout the year for guests who had made non-refundable/pre-paid reservations to cancel bookings without penalty.<br><br>
        We continue to have several ways to support guests to book and amend travel plans as necessary:<br><br>
        
        <b>Making changes as needed:</b>All bookings made directly with the continental (through the continental’s websites, mobile app, call centers or with the hotel directly), including non-refundable/pre-paid rates, can be changed without charge prior to the hotel’s cancellation deadline – although changing the date on any reservations may result in different pricing. Please see the booking information on your booking confirmation for details on the time period for any changes to bookings.
        
        <br><br><b>Making the right choice for your next booking:</b> We have several different rates and flexible booking options for guests to consider what works best for you, including:<br><br>
    <ol >
        <li><b>Best Flexible Rate:</b> This rate offers maximum flexibility to change or cancel your reservation. For direct bookings this rate can be fully changeable or refundable 24 hours in advance and in some cases up to 6pm (local hotel time) on the day of arrival (dependent on the hotel’s disclosed individual house policy).</li><br>
        <li><b>Book Now, Pay Later:</b> This recently updated rate offers flexibility and savings. With no deposit required and cancellations possible up to 3 days before your stay for direct bookings, you can travel on your terms.</li><br>
        <li><b>The Continental Rewards Member Exclusive Rates:</b> Additional savings are available for The Continental Rewards members on these Book Now, Pay Later and Best Flexible rates.</li><br>
        <li><b>The Continental Rewards Reward nights:</b> You can change or cancel these bookings with no penalty prior to the time period set by the hotel.</li><br>
  </ol>
        Important Information:
    <ol >
        <li>Please note these and other rates have their own terms and conditions – including specific cancellation and change terms. This may include some non-refundable pre-payment or other restrictions e.g. special event restrictions or specific offers. Please refer to specific rate information when booking for further details.</li>

        <li>Hotels are subject to local law in the market in which they operate. Therefore, government legislation and regulations may supersede this policy in specific circumstances. (including the ability to refund and/or the type and timing of the refund)</li>

        <li>If you cancel a rate which required a deposit or payment in advance at the appropriate time based on your rate T’s & C’s, we will do everything we can to process your refund as quickly as possible. Refunds (which may be vouchers where allowed by local law) may take up to 90 days for hotels to process from the date of cancellation. Reservations may be changed without a fee but may result in different pricing.</li>

        <li><b>Bookings via a third-party:</b> For bookings made through an online booking platform (e.g. Booking.com, Expedia) or third-party travel professionals, please contact them directly and refer to their terms and conditions.</li>

       <li><b>Groups & Meetings Bookings:</b> We will work with customers to manage any changes needed to Group & Meeting bookings on a case by case basis. Our hotels are actively supporting groups and meetings organizers to address the needs of each group. Please contact the hotel the booking was made with to discuss further - If the hotel is unavailable, send an email to 1800meetings@the continental.com.</li>

        <li><b>Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas:</b> Six Senses properties may have different rates, terms and restrictions. See the Six Senses website for more details.</li>
